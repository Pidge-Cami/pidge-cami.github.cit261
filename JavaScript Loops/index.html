<h1>Variables</h1>
<p>Variables store data values. They act very similar to the variables in Algebra. They act as containers
that hold values. Variables are always defined with the keyword <strong>var</strong> followed by the vairable name.
Variable names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs and are case sensative. For example x and X
are two different variables. Variables use the assingment opporator "=" to assign a value to the variable. </p>
<h1>Functions</h1>
<p>JavaScript uses Functions to perform certain tasks. A function is a block of code that is executed when something
calls it. A function always starts with the keyword <strong>function</strong> followed by the name of the function and then
with parentheses. The function name follows the same criteria as a variable name. They can contain letters, digits,
underscores, and dollar signs and are case sensative. The parentheses after the function name can contain multiple parameters
seperated by commas. These act as local vairables. After the function and parameters, the code to be executed is placed within curly brackets {}. </p>
 
 
 
<h2>JavaScript Function Example</h2>
 
<p>function myFunction(a, b) {<br>
    return a + b; <br>
}<br>
document.getElementById("fundemo").innerHTML = myFunction('WibbilyWobbily ', 'TimeyWimey');</p>
 
<h2>The Code in Action</h2>
 
 
 
<p id="fundemo"></p>
 
<script>
function myFunction(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
document.getElementById("fundemo").innerHTML = myFunction('WibbilyWobbily ', 'TimeyWimey');
</script>
 
 
<h1>Conditional Statements</h1>
<p>Conditional statments allow you to write code that can perform different actions for different scenerios. There are four different types of
Conditional Statements. <br>
-<strong>if</strong> statements are used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.<br>
-<strong>else</strong> statements are used to execute a block of code if the same condition is false.<br>
-<strong>else if</strong> statements are used to execute a block of code if the first condition is false but the second condition
is true.<br>
-<strong>switch</strong> statements are used to execute many different blocks of code.</p>
 
<h2>If Statement</h2>
 
<p><strong>Example</strong> <br>
 
<p>Display "Call the Doctor!" if the bad guy is an alien<br>
 
var badGuy ="Alien" <br>
if (badGuy === "Alien") {<br>
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Call the Doctor!";<br>
}
 
</p>
<p><strong>The Code in Action</strong></p>
 
<p>Display "Call the Doctor!" if the bad guy is an alien</p>
 
<p id="demo">Call the Doctor!</p>
 
<script>
var badGuy ="Alien"
if (badGuy === "Alien") {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Call the Doctor!";
}
 
 
</script>
 
<h1>Arrays</h1>
<h1>Associative Arrays</h1>
 
<h1>Loops</h1>
<p>Loops run the same code over and over again each time resulting in different values. These are especially useful when
working with Arrays.</p>
<p>According to W3Schools.com, there are several different kinds of loops.</p>
<p><strong>for - loops</strong> through a block of code a number of times <br>
<strong>for/in - loops</strong> through the properties of an object<br>
<strong>while - loops</strong> through a block of code while a specified condition is true<br>
<strong>do/while - also loops</strong> through a block of code while a specified condition is true<br></p>
 
<h2>The Doctor JS Loop</h2>
 
<p id="demo1"></p>
 
<script>
var theDoctor = ["William Hartnell","Patrick Troughton","Jon Pertwee","Tom Baker","Peter Davison","Colin Baker","Sylvester McCoy","Paul McGann",
"Christopher Eccleston", "David Tennant", "Matt Smith", "Peter Capaldi", "Jodie Whittaker"];
var text = "";
var i;
for (i = 0; i < theDoctor.length; i++) {
    text += theDoctor[i] + "<br>";
}
document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = text;
</script>
 
<h2>For Loops</h2>
 
<p>For-Loops are comprised of three statements. The first statement is code that is executed before the loop or the code block starts.
The second statement is in charge of defining the condition for running the code block or loop. The third statement starts each time the code block or loop
has been executed.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p><strong>for</strong> (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) { <br>
    code block to be executed<br>
}</p>
 
<h2>The Doctor JS Loop Omitting Statement 1</h2>
 
<p>It is possible to skip the first statement in a For Loop if your values are set before the loop starts.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
 
<p><strong>var</strong> theDoctor = ["William Hartnell","Patrick Troughton","Jon Pertwee","Tom Baker","Peter Davison",<br>
"Colin Baker","Sylvester McCoy","Paul McGann","Christopher Eccleston", "David Tennant", "Matt Smith", "Peter Capaldi", "Jodie Whittaker"];<br>
<br>
<strong>var</strong> i = 4;<br>
<strong>var len</strong>= theDoctor.length;<br>
<strong>var text</strong> = "";<br>
 
<strong>for</strong>(; i < len; i++) {<br>
    text += theDoctor[i] + "< br>";
}
</p>
<h3>The Code In Action</h3>
<p id="demo2"></p>
 
<script>
var theDoctor = ["William Hartnell","Patrick Troughton","Jon Pertwee","Tom Baker","Peter Davison","Colin Baker","Sylvester McCoy","Paul McGann",
"Christopher Eccleston", "David Tennant", "Matt Smith", "Peter Capaldi", "Jodie Whittaker"];
var i = 4;
var len = theDoctor.length;
var text = "";
 
for (; i < len; i++) {
    text += theDoctor[i] + "<br>";
}
 
document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = text;
</script>
 
<p>Statement two could also be omitted. If statement two returns true, the loop repeats. If it returns false, the loops ends. In order to leave out statement two,
a break must be included inside the loop. If not, the loop will repeat forever, which will crash the browser.</p>
 
<h2>The Doctor JS Loop Omitting Statement 3</h2>
<p>Statement three usually increases the value of the initial variable by a determined amount. It can handle negative increments as well as positive increments.
It is also opptional if the value is incremented inside the loop.</p>
 
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
 
<p><strong>var</strong>theDoctor = ["William Hartnell","Patrick Troughton","Jon Pertwee","Tom Baker","Peter Davison","Colin Baker","Sylvester McCoy","Paul McGann",
"Christopher Eccleston", "David Tennant", "Matt Smith", "Peter Capaldi", "Jodie Whittaker"];<br>
<br>
 
<strong>var</strong> i = 0;<br>
<strong>var len</strong> = theDoctor.length;<br>
<strong>var text</strong> = "";<br>
 
for (; i < len; ) { <br>
    text += theDoctor[i] + "< br>";<br>
    i++;<br>
}
</p>
<h3>The Code In Action</h3>
 
<p id="demo3"></p>
 
<script>
var theDoctor = ["William Hartnell","Patrick Troughton","Jon Pertwee","Tom Baker","Peter Davison","Colin Baker","Sylvester McCoy","Paul McGann",
"Christopher Eccleston", "David Tennant", "Matt Smith", "Peter Capaldi", "Jodie Whittaker"];
 
var i = 0;
var len = theDoctor.length;
var text = "";
 
for (; i < len; ) {
    text += theDoctor[i] + "<br>";
    i++;
}
document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = text;
</script>
 
<h2>The For/In Loop</h2>
 
<p>The for/in statment loops through the properties of an object.</p>
 
 
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
 
<p><strong>var</strong> info = "";<br>
<strong>var</strong> companion = {fname:"Amy", lname:"Pond", age:19, Doctor:11}; <br>
<strong>var</strong>= x;<br>
 
<strong>for</strong>(x in companion){<br>
               info += companion[x] +"";<br>
}
</p>
<h3>The Code In Action</h3>
 
<p id="demo4"></p>
 
<script>
var info = "";
var companion = {fname:"Amy", lname:"Pond", age:19, Doctor:11};
var x;
for (x in companion) {
    info += companion[x] + " ";
}
document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = info;
</script>
 
<h2>While and Do/While Loop</h2>
 
<p>While loops repeat a loop or block of code until a specified condition is no longer true. If the condition is false
to start with, the loop will not be executed at all. </p>
 
<p><strong>The following code block is told to increase the value of n by one but only while n is less than 20. Since it is a While loop,
it checks to ensure the code is true before it executes it.</strong><p>
 
<p id="demo5"></p>
 
<script>
var text = "";
var n = 10;
while (n < 20) {
    text += "<br>The number is " + n;
    n++;
}
document.getElementById("demo5").innerHTML = text;
</script>
 
 
<p>The Do/While loop is similar, but it execute the code first before checking to see if the condition is true. It then
continues to repeat until the condition is false.</p>
 
<p><strong>The code below is told to increase the value of c by 1 but only while c is less than 90. Since it is a Do loop, it
executes the code first, and then checks to see if it is true. In this case, it is false, so the loop only runs once.</strong></p>
 
<p id="demo6"></p>
 
<script>
var text = ""
var c = 100;
 
do {
    text += "<br>The number is " + c;
    c++;
}
while (c < 90); 
 
document.getElementById("demo6").innerHTML = text;
</script>
 
<p><strong>Here we can see that a while loop is gathering from an array the names of the Doctor's companions.</strong></p>
<p id="demo7"></p>
 
<script>
var companions = ["Sarah Jane Smith","Rose Tyler","Jack Harkness","Mickey Smith","Donna Noble","Martha Jones","Amy Pond","Rory Williams",
"River Song", "Clara Oswald", "Matt Smith", "Bill Potts"];
var i = 0;
var text ="";
while (companions[i]) {
 
    text +="<br>The companion of the Doctor is "+ companions[i] +"<br>";
    i++;
}
document.getElementById("demo7").innerHTML = text;
</script>
